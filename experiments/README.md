README:

Various tests for functionality,
- how did downloading a file go, again?
- can I dl a file from a site and display/embed it on my webpage?
- can I upload a file to a ftp server with a script
- how does one make a page that updates itself automagically in the browser if the source has changed?

TODO:
* Create a WYSIWYG page that updates a flat HTML file
    - TinyMCE testing in "editblog.php"
    - Uploads using "download_image"
* If year has changed, generate an archive file from the old HTML file and add link to it to the new HTML file.
